Just a couple things.
1. This is all my code with a little bit of stackoverflow.
2. I am not amazing and a lot of this will be hot garbage inefficient code that looks terrible.
3. Some of the early ones (~10-25) don't use the base template and may need a little configuring to get working.
4. This is all free to use but it would be lovely if you credit me
5. Critique and recommendations are encouraged! Let me hear what I can do better. It's the only way I'll improve.
