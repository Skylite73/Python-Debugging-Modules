Just a couple things.
1. This is all my code with a little bit of stackoverflow.
2. I am not amazing and a lot of this will be hot garbage inefficient code that looks terrible.
3. This is all free to use but it would be lovely if you credit me (see LICENSE)
4. Critique and recommendations are encouraged! Let me hear what I can do better. It's the only way I'll improve.

What things do:
Timer -- Basically just the normal timeit module with some printing for convenience.
Debugger -- Collects variable data at set places then forms a table of data.
Plotter -- Not really done yet. Will be a simplistic matplotlib plotter.
